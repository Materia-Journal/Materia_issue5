    caption: "This diagram illustrates the traditional leading technique in stained glass. Flat glass pieces (indicated in green) are interconnected by slotting them into lead came (shown in gray). The lead joints are subsequently soldered at both the front and the back, enhancing structural integrity (soldering details not depicted)."

Despite its small scale, *Peacock Window* exemplifies the artist’s mastery of the medium and its pivotal role in the evolution of stained-glass artistry."

    caption: "This detail, located on the reverse of one of the peonies, reveals an additional painted area where the artist applied a wash of oil-based paint. The texture is created through the technique of hatching, achieved by scraping away the paint. While the definitions of the marks are not visible from the front view, they nonetheless contribute to a mottled effect on the peonies, subtly influencing their visual appearance."

The craquelure originating from the original manufacturing process, due to incompatible expansion rates of the glass, creates a mesmerizing effect under transmitted illumination."

The organic nature of the piece suggests personal manipulation, and the presence of embedded grime and calcification, which are absent elsewhere in the window, suggests a selection from an older glass source. This unique piece creates a blurred ethereal effect under transmitted illumination."

Temple Fund, 1901. Image source: Philadelphia Museum of Art / Bridgeman Images.\n\nA concept similar to that of La Farge but with a different outcome is visible in Tiffany’s use of crater-textured glass forms. Although the craters vary in size and pattern, there is a consistent softness, depth, and distribution throughout the piece."

    caption: "Initially perceived as dense and challenging to interpret, this detail of the peacock under normal illumination reveals how La Farge colored his putties to match the hues of adjacent glass. Green-toned putty is utilized in the gaps beside the green glass, a technique also evident with the purple and orange putties. The use of colored putty may have been intended to avoid adding to lead lines and instead add color to the area in normal and/or transmitted light."

The edges of flat glass pieces (indicated in green) are joined by wrapping the connecting edges with copper foil. These foiled areas are then soldered on the front and back (not depicted). Copper foil allows for thinner lead lines, varied widths along the same line, and joining intricate shapes and small glass pieces."

A joining plate that fit beside the peony into the heart was temporarily removed for treatment, revealing the copper foil. The copper foil tends to extend the top flange of the peony, helping to create a thicker lead line. This method is visible around all cloisonné areas."

    caption: "Surrounding the peacock, including along the proper left border of the head, the copper foil serves a dual purpose: it extends the flange at the top and is also applied along adjacent glass plates to address any gaps. This copper foil supports the putty, which in turn blocks light leakage."
